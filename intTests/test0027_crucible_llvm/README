This is a basic smoke test of the crucible LLVM verification support.

It explicitly pokes at a somewhat delicate issue; that of the representation
of bitvector values that happen to be of the same length as pointers.  These
require special recognition in on the SAWScript side.  This test is
included largely to ensure that this support continues to be exercised.
