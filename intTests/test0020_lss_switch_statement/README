These tests exercise various bits of the LLVM symbolic simulator that involve doing symbolic merges
at function return points.  Because clang doesn't usually emit code that causes such symbolic
merges, some of the test programs in this directory are generated via hand-modifed LLVM assembly
(namely, test_switch.ll and test_switch3.ll).

Note, some of these tests actually use branches (test_switch.ll). So, we're not so good at naming things.
See GaloisInc/llvm-verifier#2 for the bug report and patches that motivated these tests.
