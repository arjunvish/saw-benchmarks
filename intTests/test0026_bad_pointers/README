This unit test is inteded to ensure that we properly get failues for certain
kinds of inappropriate pointer uses.  In particular, pointer dereference after free,
double free, freeing illegal memory (stack or global memory), and certain kinds of
pointer comparisons after free are not allowed.

The included C file and SAW script explicity exercise these illegal behaviors
and check that they are, in fact, rejected by the Crucible LLVM verification
prodecure.
